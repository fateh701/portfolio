                        As electric mobility becomes increasingly important, especially in developing countries, E-rickshaws have emerged as a key sustainable transportation mode. Traditionally, Brushless DC (BLDC) motors dominate this space due to their efficiency and high torque. However, their dependence on rare-earth magnets increases costs and supply chain risks. This project presents an alternative: a high-performance induction motor (IM) specifically designed for E-rickshaws, eliminating rare-earth dependencies and reducing operational costs.
